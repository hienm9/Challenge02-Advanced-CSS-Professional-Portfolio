# Challenge 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
This is the web page of my porfolio. It was build from scratch using HTML, CSS and there are some image holders for the cards. The main idea of this project is to use CSS with Flex box to wrap content in containers, and have a hover state on the cards. The cards are clickable. Also, use Media query to make the web page responsive to smaller screen sizes such as Surface Pro and Mobile phones. 

At the top of the page contains a header:
    My name on the top left.
    Four links on the right with bottem border
        AboutMe - click will take user to the About Me section on the page
        Work - click will take user to the Work section on the page
        Contact Me - click will take user to the Contact Me section at the bottom
        Resume - click will take user to my Linkedin profile

The second section below contains a hero image with a subtitle on the bottom right
Below are the body sections. 
    On each section I made a container on the left and a container on the right.
    The left contains displays the section title.
    The right container displays the detail information about the section.
        About Me section - only has information text 
        Work section - There are sub-containers that are clickable. 
                    - The first container or the first child container displays on the whole row.
                    - The rest 4 containers are displayed with two in one row.
                    - There is small box in each card show a title with description of the job.
                    - The cards are clickable. I only have a holder link (href="#") at the moment. This will be added in the future.
                    - The cards have a blue border displays on the card when user them

Last section which is Contact me. All items on the right container phone, email, github, twitter, spotify are clickable and have a bottom border.
